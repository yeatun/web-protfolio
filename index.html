            <h2>BIG DREAM</h2>
            <h3 >becomes number one webdeveloper</h3>
            <p>Many developers have thought about starting a blog at some point in their career but few of them actually get round to doing it. Often it’s because of concerns like “What on earth could I say about this? I’m not the best on this topic,” or “I won’t be able to deal with the haters’ comments,” or even “I’m a coder, not a writer. I don’t know how to write a publication.”</p>
